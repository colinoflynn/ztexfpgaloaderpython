ZTEX FPGA Loader in Python

This was generated by automatically converting the source .java files to python with java2python 0.51. The java code was pre-processed
with the Jacobe software (see http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/products/jacobe/Jacobe.html), as there was some bug in the
java2python program.

Stuff then ripped out and made to work in the most basic fashion (RAM loading + FPGA loading ONLY on the 1.11c type board).
